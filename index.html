          <p>
            I'm Oyindamola Ibrahim, ALT/SOE/024/5808. I joined AltSchool to
            learn and grow as a Cloud Engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe cloud engineering is very important for todayâ€™s digital
            world.With more businesses using cloud services, I want to be part
            of this change.
          </p>

            This program will help me learn the skills I need to succeed in tech
            and make a difference with projects that use cloud computing to help
            businesses grow.

          <ul>
            <li>To understand cloud computing concepts.</li>
            <li>To build projects that showcase my skills.</li>
            <li>To kickstart a career in tech.</li>
